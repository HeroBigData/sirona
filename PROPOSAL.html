<h1>Proposal for <em>monitoring</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>Entreprise Java application are expected to be scalable, performant, flexible, maintainable and highly available. 
To ensure this, we need to instrument the application with tooling, both during development to detect design 
bottlenecks and on production to monitor application behaviour and health.
</p>
<p>
The standard Java Management eXtension (JMX) provides the required backbone for nice management and monitoring 
tools, but with the cost of complexity and requirement for application to compute the state it wants to expose.
</p>
<p>
Profilers give very detailled report on code execution, performance, memory usage and thread-safety, but can only 
be used during developpement.
</p>
<p>
Some opensource project allready try to fill the gap by providing simple monitoring tools :
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jamonapi.com">JamonAPI</a> is a well known monitoring toolkit, but lacks for a modular design
and a clean tooling (separation between code and tests..). It is driven by a single individual, and as a 
result doesn't take advantage of an apache-like community driven emulation.</li>
<li><a href="http://http://moskito.anotheria.net">Moskito</a> is nicely designed, but requires some technical
inheritence and for this reason is too much intrusive. Its user community is still tiny accoring to sourceforge statistics</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>This proposal is to create a new apache commons component to provide a simple monitoring infrastructure, with simplicity and 
extensibility in mind, and following Apache quality standards. By beeing hosted in apache commons, it expect to gather talentuous
developers curisoity / interest and to envolve as a must-have component for java developers.
.</p>


<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>monitoring</em> relies on standard Java 5 (or later) APIs for
production deployment.  It utilizes the JUnit unit testing framework for
developing and executing unit tests, but this is of interest only to
developers of the component.</p>
<p>Retrotranslator is used to create a backport version of the component to get used under Java 1.3 or 1.4. On such
runtimes, backport-util-concurrent will be required.</p>
<p><em>monitoring</em> provides Helper classes for various frameworks to make monitoring easier. Those dependencies
are only required by user wanting to use them. Maven meta-datas are declared as <code>optional</code> to avoid unexpected transitive 
dependencies.</p>

<p>No external configuration files are utilized.</p>


<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>The original Java classes are created from scratch based on some initial experiments to
build a clean monitoring toolkit.</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.monitoring</code>.</p>


<h3>(3)  Required Apache Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>SVN Repository - New directory <code>monitoring</code> in the
    <code>commons</code> SVN repository.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>dev@commons.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [monitoring].</li>
<li>Bugzilla - New component "monitoring" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the monitoring component shall be:
<ul>
  <li><a href="mailto:nicolas@apache.org">Nicolas De Loof</a></li>
</ul>
